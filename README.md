# DainsFixesLuckyFix
microfix for Lucky script so it actually adds stats instead of only decreasing them
download repository as zip, extract Dain's Fixes folder and then merge it with the same folder from original mod so you get an override prompt for effect_lucky.* files or manually grab and replace files in Dain's Fixes\Tweaks\Lucky
